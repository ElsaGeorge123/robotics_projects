# ðŸ¤– 2D Robotic Arm Simulator

A simple 2D robotic arm simulator built with Python.  
It visualizes forward kinematics for a series of joints and links.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Define multiple links and joints
- Compute end-effector position using forward kinematics
- Visualize the arm in 2D with `matplotlib`

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used
- Joints and links representation
- Forward kinematics (FK)
- Basic trigonometry and rotation
- 2D plotting using matplotlib

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed (3.8+ recommended).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/2d-robotic-arm-simulator.git
cd 2d-robotic-arm-simulator
pip install -r requirements.txt
